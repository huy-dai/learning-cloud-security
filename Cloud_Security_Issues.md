1. Misconfiguration:
   1. Misconfigurations are one of the leading cause of cloud data breaches. Cloud infrastructure by designed are meant to be easy to use and to share data, but this also makes it difficult for organizations to ensure that their data is only accessible for by intended and authorized parties. 
   2. Also, companies can only rely on the security controls provided by their **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** to configure and secure their deployments, which are often specific to the vendor. Thus for companies that run multi-cloud deployment, it is easy for a misconfiguration to occur or for security oversight to leave an organization's cloud resources exposed to attackers
2. Unauthorized access
   1. Improper configurations or compromised credentials can easily lead to an attacker to have direct access to an organization cloud services
3. Insecure APIS   
   1. The CSPs will provide a number of APIs and interfaces for their customers to use. However, this also depends on the customers to properly securing their interfaces 
4. Hijacking of Accounts
5. Lack of visibility
   1. With an organization's cloud based resources being located outside of their corporate network, traditional tools used for ensuring network visibility are not effective for cloud environments, and some organizations lack the necessary cloud-focused security tools to monitor and guard their cloud resources
6. External Sharing
   1. Organizations must be very careful in terms of who they share their data with. **Link-based sharing** is a very popular option but it also makes it difficult to control access to the shared resource.
7. Malicious Insider
8. Cyberattacks
9. DDoS
